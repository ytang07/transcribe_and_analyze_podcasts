No   I'm safe and happy and life is beautiful   And how do we measure it? In the in the vernacular, what I mean by intelligence is just being smart, how well you reason how well you figure things out   What you do when you don't know what to do   If you wanna do research on intelligence, measuring something  That you can study scientifically is a little trickier   And that is what is common     And he     So he inferred from this   Absolutely right   Isn't that independent     Yeah   We're hoping we can get away of being poetic   We can     That's all true   It is      And that is the common     So You don't know how to increase the g fast Okay   And what are those? You can't measure g directly   Let me just thank you   We're trying to sneak up on   You know, i I get that a lot about being uncomfortable talking about this   So it's not It's not easily made specialized   And this is what makes people comfortable   Mh   That's not so easy to to explain   You can now compare       Is that stable across tests and so on or no       True and men and women   Interesting   We don't know   They they have     They did different at battery of tests   Sorry   A little bit of a tangent okay   I mean, this is interesting because you're right   Mh   Mh   True or false   Well, first all is fascinating But from     Like, how do you get to     Like, what is dust Para system referred to? So it's the test is in imp   Like, it makes it very difficult for you to somehow figure out what what you're supposed to answer   Yes   Got it   Okay   So I don't wanna go too far a afield on it   Yeah   So anyway, sorry   Mh   Okay? Got is a     Okay   Excellent   So that was removed   Okay   What you were saying Okay    And when I'm done, I want you to repeat them back to me  Mh  Ready? Okay  Seven four two eight one, six   So me  Seven four two eight one six  K       I quit   Backward   Well, you said I can't even remember them     What does memory have do so let's let's hold on  So alright   Well, the two events less cultural? Well, it turns out vocabulary is highly correlated, and it turns out that digit span backwards  Is highly correlated   That's you how do you figure? Right? It's not really hard, almost everybody gets it all right   This is fascinating   So what what role crossing   Like, I was never     I mean, I just don't enjoy tests   I enjoyed going back into my cave and working   Yeah   I hear that a lot   Yeah   Say well, fine   They are highly g loaded   I took this At and I think it was called the Act where I was to also     It's interesting because I know that what they're measuring I could see being correlated was or something   And I think people are college admissions letting go of that very much   Oh yes   Yeah   But what does that even mean? Well, they they already exist       Yes  And it it's possible, but it's statistically unlikely   It's interesting   It's interesting    But it's still true   In always of life   So maybe that's not anxiety   Maybe that's something     you know, like, personality is also pretty stable     And who can't relate to that? Mh   And they won't take people with Iq under     Absolutely       We we'll get to that     But nobody does that      It just doesn't happen   But well let me ask you this   So we'll jump around     I tend to     Right? Like, you know, people wanna maybe the temptation task better what better the sports so on   No   What do we do with that? Okay   But you are correct in that   Is there something you'd be said? They were     I wonder if You know, there's a g factor for intelligence   But it's independent whatever it is   It's independent of intelligence   So, I I agree with you about that   But let me say this   Mh     I said, damn, this one will make it smarter, This one will make it dumb   Are there any circumstances under which you would choose to be dumb? Well let me ask you this   No   So So    Okay   With     It doesn't work     Yeah   Show it     There's nothing to it   Mh  Nothing to it at all  But  But but wouldn't it be something? So I wonder if there's a threshold   No     It's I'm not exactly sure   Yes   That's more let's as       Yes   It was a a film that was very good  Mh     Yeah   Mh   that They're very clear about this   Nonetheless, people took away   Nothing has changed that   It's unfortunate   This really became in inc   I knew him as well   I But he went a step further, a fateful step further     I would go on to say   Skim be controversial     It's always been controversial, but it was even skim and controversial     But it was that intense   Nobody wanted to talk about it  And then it it it didn't       Yeah   Yeah   That's what we wanted you to talk about   Yeah  And she said, well, what do you mean? I see   Interesting saying   She said, would you say that on television? I've thought about this a lot   It's all about what causes them and how to fix it   So are you okay with that? And they sure   It's a minefield   The way I talk about it, I       And I've concluded it doesn't matter  This    Now I I know what he meant this  The guts to say that wow   It was the default   It should be tested     He was happy to move on something else   It doesn't matter what they believe   I personally believe for me   I'm not seeing that broadly well size     It's     Yeah   I think it matters   So I don't know   What do you want me do?  And we    Like, I have    What      What do you think on that spectrum? They're nuanced   I wrote about this   That I received   I have so much         That's fascinating   Now, of course, this has been very controversial   They've retreated somewhat   Let's take race out of it   And this has been replicated now        I've seen it  I've seen that  Yeah It makes it difficult to sort of is limiting as opposed to empowering     That That's Yeah   Yes   Not impossible, but it's very difficult   Fourteen million children have iq under eighty five   Is this something we want to ignore? You know when you have people with iq under eighty five and you have achievement in school or achievement in life     They were wrong not only were they were wrong   Didn't know I didn't know the     That's interesting     It's highly man   I'm I'm under care about this   And he didn't care   Yeah  He didn't care Didn't   It's a politically     Listen       But there's a balance there   So I understand   This is really interesting   I didn't     I didn't know       So you know, he's he he can certainly defend himself   He doesn't need me to to do that   Every everything you said here calmly and thoughtfully, is difficult   This is difficult for me to even consider that g factor exists   It's just     Because one definition of intelligence is based on how much you can learn and how much you can remember   Some now are coming around to it   But I I said, don't you think they're the key though? He said, you you you don't wanna go there   Because we have we have now data   And not everybody agrees on you know what success means   Now, okay   That says something about your level of success   You know, you but for variables, Yeah However you want to define success  Iq is important   And the more complex your vocation the more complex job the more g matters   Within an occupation, the g might not matter so much   Okay? So but that    That's really that's a boy   That's very interesting, but it's also I don't know somehow painful   I don't know why it's so painful   Yeah painful   Yes   I don't know if she was actually implying that you're born with it   Well to trade It's a trade  A that's relatively stable over time   That I think that's generally correct     Yeah  Yeah  That's painful too   Because it's like Oh, shit   I'm stuck with this  I'm stuck with this   This is who you are   I mean, we should set         What what how do you     So what's the plan?     Oh, boy   That's what it looks like    Yes Yeah     But there's still to back on that   Many of them would assert that       Yes   And does anyone believe intelligence has nothing to do with the brain? Okay I mean, it's so obvious   Well, indirectly definitely has to do with it, It's not, hey, it's pre programmed   Well but also, yeah   So there's a lot a lot   Like you said how things connect up   I guess what I'm asking you is, can you see where what you just said it might be wrong? To say, you know what? Like, you'll see g factor be able to be modified throughout life   Yes   Yeah   It would have been obvious   He said, well, maybe these maybe we need to start earlier   Yeah  It's always an infinite Well, maybe we didn't get it right   That's why I       I could believe that   I could easily believe that   And and it is   Yeah   It's because       Okay   Yes   And so you could       Yes   Right  This is you strange for that strange   I'm not sure exactly   But there But how that be explained?   That allows that   It's unclear to me   Unravel consciousness   What is that? And I    And I     And therefore, I think they must be related   And we he he was amazing   You know nothing   It's not so clear   But maybe has something do with the   I'm not sure anybody has pursued this   You know, I I I'm retired now       Yeah   Yeah   That's very interesting   So I tried to find out  Mh     I'm not sure that's literally true, but it's     Well it might be very difficult to know precisely how deep you are   It's it's it's difficult is difficult to know   He said, no, he did doesn't know     He said no   Or less   It could go either way   Yeah  And be interesting again   They they could be inverse correlated   Wouldn't that be funny, if you     Right? iq? Yeah  Something I've never done it   But the     No yes, sure It would it would fail   So that         Oh  Heard that I just like to know about I I'll I'll I'll I'll actually email you this because you'd be very interesting for you   But it it deserves a lot of attention, which is     Where you have to do, you know, one standard one is       And for that, it least simplifies to Nobody's been able to do well on on his   It takes a lot it takes a lot of research, but it also takes a lot novelty generating Do you think we'll be able to because we spoke     I do   So some people you have to be un   I mean, yeah, this is this is not easy   You know, I     And they start to wonder what that has     I look at everything about the brain   Yeah   You Yeah   No   But it's not dependent entirely on intelligence   Absolutely  I I I certainly agree with that    I don't know   That's all I mean   Right? It's not so easy   He didn't say how   But let's talk about the why   Why are we here? Oh, I'm not gonna tell you   Do you know if you i gonna tell me   Are you are you afraid the of it? Think I about it more and more as I get older   Yeah  I I do   That it is finite  We all know it   Most of us deny it and don't wanna think about it   And sometimes you kinda walk past it and you wanna look at it, but it's still there   Yeah   You're not listening to me They're hopeless   I would like to fix some of it as best I can   Well, thank you for asking me
