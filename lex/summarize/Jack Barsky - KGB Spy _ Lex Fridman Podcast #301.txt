 So it wasn't       It was focused on whoever we you didn't like   Too   So there's      What did you maybe feel? Okay? Right? So but we didn't know that   Yeah   What is that? And then    Oh let let's do  For     Yes  They were     Right? But why did he blu her so bad not to read the intelligence that was coming his way   Hey heads ahead   He and it I forgot exactly what it was, but it was     Yeah  I mean, they're     So it's difficult   Right? He was aware that there was intelligence that there was that was collected to study was really good   It didn't quite fit   Mh   So     Guess where they wound up   They were the   So but let's backtrack     Yeah  But as a       How's was that   Would you make that? Guess? Mh   They were beautiful and they had to be adored  And one of them actually loved me too   She came after me  Initially   Right? And that was like that was     That too was magical for you   Oh my god    You're gonna have to work hard that world to be somebody that could be adored by the    By those you like   Yes  You're right  You know that that Kiss   He wasn't he was older and he was more experienced  Yeah  And he was gonna be a doctor, and I    But, you know, I was there and he was not the, you know, presence wins Yes   Oh, yeah     So it was back and forth back and forth and the      Oh my god that hurt  I can still feel it    But it at the time, it it it emptied me out Yeah   It was     Let me see   Alright? So    But I     What I did was I I I wanted to go on   Right?  I just, like, I worked my ass often, and since I was pretty smart to, I just ate practically everything   Like i Yeah  And I know that one  That's true      Easy now  It's true   So we should also clarify that danny professor or not     Yep   Absolutely was    And I would     Right? You know, you know, have access to things that that are nice   Yeah   Right?     The not what's s? Start security for the state   And so when you when you look through this in And this is what the Kgb was looking for Right? Absolutely right     And they knew that I was by myself   How did they know it? And he was next door to me  And he    you know, he he be prevented me  So he he got to know me a little bit   Right? So somebody knocks   We would wait for somebody to to let us in   I I knew that was stranger I said come on in       So I'm sorry to pause briefly   We we knew that the s existed   Okay  Thank you for pointing that out     So we     You So this was my favorite     And I and I tell you why I know that   Why would they have the wanna have their own? Yeah   Yeah   Okay  This is a     If fascinating  Yeah  Okay  So there you are  Welcomed by the Kgb I would meet him once a week once every two weeks   Yes   Yes     What you how it was? So what what was dynamic? Tell me? He didn't like that   You didn't like   Was was    No   No  He just you know cg he told     That's that's all   Or was it implied? I don't believe that was for them to give him to the s   It was just like how well do I characterize people? Was that did that come naturally to you? The no no   I hated it   Doctor to? I think I didn't know that I had it    Beautiful  I did well   Right? And then how did that progress? Right? And the mean what was then well can you give a little more I don't remember?       Mh  Stupid   So     You you know i know  I'm not  Actually, there were two And that was very important   Okay  Okay  So       They Right?   Now   He hadn't a       Or They they wouldn't let him back in   Oh, I see  They     So     Alright? And he's germany   Yeah  All of his germany  Yes   Yes   I didn't need that   I understood   Most of it   And then then he sprung it on me and I was not prepared he said, so what are you in or not?? I was     No  I'm gonna I wasn't expecting that would come and Yeah  But I gotta tell you, we need people who are decisive     Yes   What help me?   Yes   Yeah  Was         What was next? Because you    Just by saying so, then that would that wouldn't have worked   Mh  That's a little late  Are you better offensive, defensive? What do you like more? You're like   Yeah  We probably won't hear much about you, but we know that you're gonna do something very important Right?   Anyway, this wasn't possible   Oh well   I didn't realize it then at all   What what do I do? So what I did, I went        That was my was going to be very basic   Pretty basic   Are you kidding   What are you complaining about? You're right   And I didn't know that, you know, that now I was really in   Okay? That's right   No   No   I know this better   I was taking it all in   So I could've have, like, asked probe a little bit, but I didn't  So I just played along   And the the      What was the train? Well what we're sort of     Yeah   They're probably designed a way that you can manually sort of it's efficient and convenient to use them manually   You know   No  I gotta disagree   It was neither efficient, nor convenient   Those are known to be un break     One use Oh, interesting   Oh right? Right   Would you know where    Can you     Easy debug? No  You     No  You do it twice  You do it twice and that's how you check   It's identical then you know well like, if it's     No  That's why  And I really didn't   But anyway     So that I was    I was learning that   Yeah  So That's why So chose it   Right? That requires you to plan the around very well     Mh so it wasn't like this   Right? This was normal   That was natural   So somebody always has to come close   Right? Did you have to also study surveillance?   Maybe I wouldn't go to the archive and go to numb     And and you pretty much     When you're done you, you know what you know     Who does that   One     Yeah   But listen    Wow, This is great   That's incredible   It's incredible   It's so powerful   It's a     We'll we're return to that because it's interesting okay   So yeah Know   Let me then know   Oh, that's interesting   And he said, you know what?       No     Yeah  Exactly right   So the other one was a middle aged   And he said the Russian was very doubtful   So I think we     And what     Is it training or is it espionage sp? No   It was raining   It was   So it was good             Nice Are we talking about the    So there's there's a nervous this about    U  Then what is that? That's interesting   Yeah  It's interesting   So English was to focus   So surveillance detection that was big   Okay  So this is what when when you find out whether you're being followed  Got it   Got got it   And And then there was this     Have you ever watched he maybe   There was a       Oh, man   That there was so     There wasn't nothing   No   Okay   Sorry   Absolutely was   Yeah  Always    It was good  I mean, I don't I I actually wonder I wonder how good it was, but I remember it being incredibly   To me, it was really good   And and, you know, you had it from white to very dark and, and all the varieties   I like it       I don't to understand      I mean, it is     No  I was     They couldn't     I didn't like it   What was the     Yes   Okay?   That was important   Yes  I had prepared to caretaker take us off the     I opened it and I was like, yes   Think about it   Okay? I would       Right? And i and I escaped with     Right? Yeah   Yeah  That's interesting   Was she lying, No   Yeah  So swiss air   When I came, where did I land? I       Mh   But    Okay     Right   Now this is now you're a spy   You're   No   It's already dark   What do I know? Didn't didn't know what that meant either   And   But you know, I was prepared   Unfortunately, I was not trained in how to train passport   I don't how to destroy passports with   So I tried to burn it    Yeah  Oh no   Okay   Yeah   I don't know what to do   No  There was no     There was no     Alright shouldn't     Fine   Yeah   So they they really didn't integrate well They didn't know what they didn't know     You see what's happening Russia   I would think so   So we talked about they did   They did     And we I found him and we looked at each other You, we know of     This is very difficult   I i Yeah   There     It would just maybe muse   It would be nice if something might to happen   And then somebody picks it up and does it   Is there     Who who would know who would know, you know, just     I I can't pretend to know this for sure, but It        I mean, he was open   So and it     And it just escalated slowly, but surely, It was pretty clear Now how do you do this? And somehow   U     It also applies to Russia   So it it exists and it is very powerful  The more weapons you can sell the more you have to replace them or send over, and you have to replace them so yes   Why don't they get it because they don't want to   It's     It it failed every time So     I Yeah  Absolutely do   Where punch came from? Yeah   Sure     Yes   And it's always     Exactly    One rocket     Mh   I don't know how that works   I don't know if anyone knows how that works   Yeah  I worry   And I've seen enough to know     They're they gonna be weak or wrong   It's     I don't I don't know how     Well, let me    Because you did     He had made him the man he is? Well, how much that does that define you who you are? Mine was one on one   Right? So     One would think, generally, we're learning here       One would think so now that       And he's still     He's still alive   Alright?  Not impressive at all   And    Well, yeah   Not only couldn't he make it up   I do n't know Mh   Right?   Yes   Yes  Let's put it this way   And  One would think that they used the best that they had to to to help me?  So how did they     You're destabilizing then   And then this is something that's actually very difficult to pull off  Because, yes   But you're saying that no intelligence, first of all, intelligence is hard     So now Be of was Kgb, where was he stationed? He made it up  Sorry   So basically detecting the artificial     Enhanced artificial yes   But but he he can also make them     Right?   Who also knows? I I used to be one Okay?     Right? Am I interesting at all? How how people determine if they're in person of interest or not? Right? Right   But I     They all present themselves as trustworthy   Now again, I have nothing     What else?  But, you know, I don't I don't know     Right? Right   So    And most of them probably won't  And and I'm guessing occasionally they will say well, I can't go there   Right? I just hope they approached me and introducing themselves properly   I I just    There's a kinda    I mean, would you know? Is it no just like what the g u? And I'm not serious   Raining but yeah   Right? And putin and likes to scare people   They were they they didn't want any anyone of them caught   Alright?   And, you know, so getting caught   I wasn't even supposed to go home     I went ready     And I still thought I need to go back because you know, there was     You know, I leave her, but, you know, maybe she she need to     That would have not worked very well   So I play for time  I       So I just did nothing   Right? Or or else you get arrested you or else your dead is very strong Right? So there was no more guessing   He he found me he talked to me   I know   So now I had to act     So I didn't have to make it a decision yet   Okay? I     It was like I was still trying to figure out what to do what to do what to do   Not hard to miss    It can't find it    So when as I'm walking away from this, like, sort of numb emotionally, I said to myself, I'm staying   You know  But it was certain there  It was right there  It was    Was it? That was it   That was it   And so what I did to     Right?     So      And how did they know about me? I         Right? Oh, I stopped completely   Yeah  Good point   They were very careful       Yeah  I'm supporting her if something doesn't quite fit   It is not because I don't love the both of them   They had both it     And he waved me, he he got me right where stopped   But I would recovered very quickly and he said it himself  So that was pretty real     Yeah  Well I I knew  I knew that I had to make them like me  And I'm      So I say so   So So    And I     because what what I know       That indicated to me already that they would let me go   You can't   So recently   What what am I talking about? What time you want you to be there?     Does get somehow   Sometimes     I   Right? Yeah  But because  Yeah   But but that's if you can't afford somebody like that, is that's good   It's good for me   Amen   Do you     Well, I I I could've have but I She took care of me   He was proud of me, but we didn't hug   We didn't     We didn't interact emotionally whatsoever   So you don't feel like you betray that   I love that that Well, I I did   I know that I know that she she was looking for me until did     She     She    Check with the s   She just was, like, held bent on finding me and couldn't find me   So if you pass away without knowing what happened to me     And everybody knew that   I called her  And Said, I said I so guess who this is when     You maybe No  We actually met   I wouldn't asking for that   I wouldn't I wasn't happy about it, but it did feel good     Yes  Are you afraid of it?   He said you gotta do this   Yes, sir
