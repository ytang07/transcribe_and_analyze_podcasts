  Please check out our sponsors in the description   And now, dear friends, here's Andrew for Monte   How does it work? It's primarily looking outward   Outside the united states correct   So we technically cannot work inside the United States   So the army, the navy has     Everything's got be prioritized   How long is it? What is it contain? So first of all, it looks like the most expensive book report you can ever imagine   It's all very high end   It feels important it looks important   Because Everybody wants to be the first on the radar   I wanna see one two three That has back backfired in the past   You serve the executive   What's that dance like?       Right? They have to be       Yeah  The challenge is how much more effective could we be if we improved? And that's     Exactly   Eight   Yeah  He has to be he or she in the United States   So first, what's the good in the bad   Sorry  Interrupt   So let me start with the good first because there a lot of people who don't think there was any good   They go find someone else to create their product   It also didn't help that Cia stepped outside of their con   That's all something the Fbi could have handled by itself   The justice department could have handled by itself       And so they start getting this   What do you think? It's rare that I'll talk about just thinking   It's     Russia is winning   Empirical, when you look at the math, they're winning   Do I know how or why I do not? I don't know how or why it works there   And yet somehow there are real results happening   What you're laying out isn't incorrect   And the mis are not unexpected   Putin did not move in there accidentally   Because in two thousand fourteen, it worked   It worked in two thousand eight   He invaded George the exact same same way and it worked   So in two thousand eight it worked in two thousand fourteen it worked   But this time, something was different     And we can jump into that anytime you want to   They reorganize leaders and then they     You saw three approaches   The first two did not work   The third has worked exactly like it's supposed to work   What you need? It takes       I agree with you     It's gonna be even than that   I I don't know You don't see it in in Congo   It's it is absolutely sad   I don't know why people seem to think that the information that they're reading in English is any more or less true   Right? There's nothing they can go to court there   It's enough to make Russians think that that they're going to lose and maybe they should just they should just give up now and leave from the battlefield now   We have to understand   And it's it's shameful   Right? It's all coming do   He will not let himself lose   Short of something completely unexpected   Right? Who knows what that might be     Right? They cannot   As sad as it is to say, man   Right?   Correct? That Crimea still with Russia That's the high likely   So he would have to be un   And then you end up seeing how it just       I mean, you what happened in now     That's what I'm saying     Don't you think attention is money   So for for Putin, resources matter      That's how you attain and maintain political power   , you would think that people would feel like they're sacrificing for something   And but again, empirical, this is     But it seems like it doesn't   And then I guess, we're probably the same why we wasting money the prices   We're sending these   is incredibly valuable     Do you think we would make it two weeks? And then we'd be on to something else   Yeah     People are beautiful   And that's what you're talking about     Nobody knows these   You know about And that is that is just the truth of it That is a famous quote   But people will persevere, people will come through   I hope so   I hope so   I just     It's just  It's striking is beautiful   It's it's beautiful to see   I don't I don't know how much you tell or just other intelligence agencies So they're the strongest   Right?   Exactly right     They want to learn from Cia   They want to train with Cia   You name it   They're the top   Miso will do anything   I mean, the United States has let people     So that's it's     There is no     Correct   And I work out i about this   Let me take a tangent on that   Yes  He's coming in this podcast   And and he talked openly about     So he's like I don't talk about  I've never talked about it  I've never exacerbated it   I let it run   If it starts getting destructive or damaging, then I have my my leadership team step into fix it   So he lets it run   You let it happen? Because it gets you further without you doing any work   And and that's what Cia does well     What does Cia do? They don't say anything   Right? It's he's so honest about that   So what did you   And yet, you also a family, man you value that   Like, what's that trade off? And when my son was born, my my wife and I found out that we were pregnant while we were still on mission   We were operating together overseas   My wife was a badass    And and she cried and she was like, what what do we do now?   So long story short, we had our baby   Because we're not type of people to wanna just sit around and be domestic  What do we do next? So here's some of our suggestions   We could do this, and we can do that   We can both operate together again during day     You said that your wife misses it     Do you miss it? We both miss it     But so smart and so dedicated and so courageous about what they do and how they do it   When you're inside, it's all     I mean, we had     I had a cat six catch well, which makes me nuclear cleared   And she misses that because she loved that kinda now   You're just one of us living in the, you know, the cloud of miss  Exactly knowing anything about what's going on   Exactly   You know what you still get to do when you leave Ci, you still get to operate   Operating is just working with people   You still get to do that   Maybe can you tell me the story of how it all began? Feel free to direct me if I'm getting too boring or if the not the   I have questions about this   Yeah  You have to  Military regulations you can't have here longer than one inch   What are the disguise? Yeah   You look different than you normally look     Maybe you go bald      You       Yeah  They are not actually agent   Even if it's just to describe why you're wearing what you're wearing, it it's all a cover   We have to remember that   Is it possible to do this? So i i I just have kind of anecdotal evidence for myself   Do you think that gives you way? So one of the flaws in your argument is that you keep referring to how you feel   I feel this   I feel that  I feel like this, I feel like that   But because They love them and just so that the woman will sleep with them   Well, don't you have to be convincing and don't you have to really know your story and don't you have to be able to defend it? Exactly right   You have to be in a bin   Just choose the bin   Right? So this is huge   There's no equality   Got Also, there's no escape   You are there until the inter has done with you   Right? That's what interrogation feels like   You don't leave until the boss says you can leave   And you're there to say to answer questions, the boss asks questions   For sure   I wanted to talk to you about your background   I could   You're exactly right   Yeah   Anywhere you choose to take it because you're the one asking questions Right?   I hope that trouble making contact  Stuff like that   Why you're right   My left is  Right, which is usually someone who's     If you ask my expression yes that's someone who's referencing fact   So if I just thought that you were lying because you look up into the right, yeah  I would be wrong   That's so fascinating   Yeah   Right? It's gonna make you look to the right   Is this a science or an art? It's a bit of both   What     About human nature   But in process will be a book I'll give you that   We don't wanna pretend like, we're, you know, independent   Man, it it hurts   Loneliness sucks   It still feels better than being alone    There is       It's there   Even if it's an em, it's there   And that's what we see   We are pen analyzing them   I'm not much better now  At forty two, but yeah   You mean  But I would make it  Yeah You had to log in and log out and slow Internet and everything else   Anyways, I was filling out an online application   So that was the path I was going down   I   They didn't say Cia   They said lang, I put one one together and I was like, maybe this is   Yeah  Like this could    How cool is this? Yeah  Or maybe this is all make believe in is totally fake   And it's easy there's no work involved   And then by the end, it was really comforting because you just did what you were told   They told you when eat     Then you just     Was that how rigorous was that?     Mh    It's kinda stressful  But it's just like going back to college again     And then you hope you just send it into the ether there and you hope that you hope that you sent it right   You hope that you wrote well enough   I saw he was wearing he saw what I was wearing Yeah   Yeah  And he was like, yeah   Yes   How effective just interesting     Or our previous this how effective of those? Yeah  But they're not actually meant to detect a lie     You never know what they're seeing and you don't know what they're doing  And it's really hard not to get anxious of that anyways  Right  Right  But but that's what they're doing they're establishing based  I mean, I guess that means the poly is is a is a skill that you develop  Absolutely to do it well   That's not hard   It's not hard to tell a lie to an interviewer  What     And the interview doesn't care if you're being honest or not honest about a topic   And I mean, a really good is is immensely valuable   But the     Now what I How much do you like being alone? That's what's so powerful about Mb i is it it's talking about what people are like when you strip away resources   There's only sixteen options   And it becomes extremely valuable   Is it perfectly precise? And does everybody do it the same? That is a resounding powerful yes   E I'm extroverted   She's a feel I'm a she's a judge     I don't believe you can do much better   And my experience, I have not seen anything better   Yeah   It seems to be true   We can't fix it   Yeah  And that defines so much of who we are  It's sad   I don't see it as sad because it's     Had to look to make sure I actually feel the floor   Right   Yeah  I I definitely have  Oh, that's good to know     Like well, the music  Mh  That's just like     I don't     First of all, I don't know how that happens   But to me, I just have an awareness of stuff   It's so it's so interesting   Yeah  You're just like, born with that   Yeah   So it's good   Which is       But what what I know if I was, You would not know if you were   For sure you've been on their radar   Absolutely   You've gotta a file   You got a dossier somewhere   Why? Would I be in the radar? Because your yours was interesting   You're it's not     If someone had access to if someone was able to clone your phone, They clone phones   Yeah  That     I'm glad to hear that   Alright  I'd     And like, why don't wide open? Like, people sign up to the study   They willingly do this to understand behavior   There's always there's the     And once they win, they have a monopoly   To to to assume everything could be public  And, you know     And so don't trade in information that could hurt people first me public   So I I tried to do that   Right? And so I tried to assume that I will be hacked and detect it   But that's that       That hopefully inspires       Correct   It's better if you can't prevent from being hacked   If you know it fast enough, you can just destroy the information   This is what the ultra wealthy do   And now they     For them, there's no break in service   Absolutely, man     It's still very new   I mean, they were sourcing     I mean, this is a strategy      I don't think it's used   It's absolutely   It's called sex   But    Yeah    That's     There's also elements of sexuality that people underestimate   Right?   That's exactly what you're there to do    That is a very complicated situation   She's also trained   And I I think my wife and I also think     You can trust again   Right? Right   And it's       Right? Some some chip that just reads everything   How heavy are they walking? How much time do they sleep? Like, which hand do they use when they log in? Yeah what what's their most common swipe? What's their most visited website? Yeah  Absolutely   Got it   Do they wield and they're     You should stay there Correct   I think that there was there was definitely     But is that correlated with ethical behavior   I would never punch somebody in the face   Right? Right? Absolutely   So without the oversight, what's holding you back? And so I totally I understand that   You have nothing to worry about   True   I This is a topic that I never get tired of talking about but it's very rare that anyone ever really agrees with me   Just so you know I don't     Nobody cares about that   That's what they're there to do   You have politicians and you have the       That's what a representative Republic is   It worked   We were safer   We are now less secure because they can't do that   And that bothers me   They know the bad and Ugly or can infer bat ugly   Now that's what people really worry about is they     Think about     Right?   Okay   Right? What do they do next? Well, let's just make it simple   I wanna know even more   So then they get this prep of evidence What do you do with evidence? It's completely different here   So one is yes   If I was a dictator and I wanted to That's what you just laid out   And that is the that is the standard i need the surveillance for that   Yep   Right?         Right   It doesn't require the surveillance   Absolutely   So let me give you just a a practical example     We had everything    Everything is intertwined  Everything is in inter linked   It's all tied together   His id was registered   Even still, he was Em rowdy, I was not   Right? It's not for people like me   You could pay this payment to each other   And that's all coming     And it's super easy they frankly already, it's so easy convenient   They've already taken for granted that of course, this is what you do   Yeah   For everybody to have Yeah  How a server that you have no idea where it's at? So you     In the eyes of a group of people, who are largely ignorant to what they lost   I'm not sure his name is tarnish   Because if he didn't, he would just be forgotten   So actually, let's linger out it   But what about to be safe? Actually, be safe   This is   So this is what's difficult   You work your ass off   Is does it     It does   First, the the mythos ethos You can't do that   They just know that if failed   Right? So you gotta keep it a secret   You think so? Absolutely   What about if if     Yeah  How much more? How they stop? Like, that's you're gonna be criticized Like, that's a     I mean, that's really bad for the Cia   It's terrible   Right? Yeah   We oftentimes forget that   It's a grind   For all of the soldiers     That is intentional     That is something nobody wants to get into   Why? Why not celebrate? The killing have been laden   I think someone was made public enough   Why not do that? That's     But most times, they don't   So Mk alt   So not a myth   Not a myth   It shows that there's interest   If there's evidence, I haven't seen it   I'm skeptical too   But I'm just like you should be open in minded anyway   Would do you make that this was on the table operation North? So it's interesting   Right? Come up with anything   Just let's start with something because we can't have     We can't bring nothing to the table     Right? That's like that is the that is a mic drop right there   I think financial   So that makes a ton of sense to me   Just seems efficient   It seems very practical   That's not how it works   So I am out of my element now    I Can something like that happen? Yeah  Right? That is one of those are two two fundamental guidelines that we follow all the time   Right? Can you can you elaborate what you mean by we? We as has intelligence professionals What are you seeing? Even right now? It's it's just embarrassing is just embarrassing   Exactly right   Let me ask about this because it comes up often   I'm very open minded about this thing     To control to manipulate to achieve it and that means, do you think there is   Right? Right? Yes   Right?   We're busy trying to build a reputation     It doesn't   Who Mh  And whether I think the We'll see then infiltrated   Right?   That's just not important   It's a it's a distraction   Correct   It's actually collecting data   Absolutely       Yeah  It's it's really difficult to know  There's We are not alone   Do you think we're not alone? There's it's an imp that we are alone   It's a mathematical equation   It's a it's a one or zero   Right? And for me, it has to exist   It     First, we observe for a while     I will try to put, like, figure out what is the language that used to communicate with each other? And so, of course, you can observe But let's look a gorillas   Mh   Right? Right? Yeah   If they wanted to communicate, wouldn't they want mimic? If they wanted to mimic, wouldn't they create devices like ours?   Exactly   We need some plan   Give me some plan   So that's where we come up with        I don't know him, but what Joe identified on his own is    So that was    When it came to this topic specifically  That was just something that I thought was really powerful because       Like, you know, a brilliant fashion He refuses to let sort of the conformity and the conventions     Yeah   Yeah   Anyway, just to take a one step for He woke up to it later   So it's it's happens to all of us   Yeah  That's the that's the really the the niche gaze into the abyss     Absolutely   This from a reddit I really enjoy   And I I was I was arguing this with him when I was fourteen years old   I told you so dad, you're still wrong   Yeah   But it's unique only to you   What do they feel right now? You know, are they comfortable? Are they uncomfortable? Are they afraid? Are they scared?   I I And we're understanding you would you say, Yeah   It's it's about feelings   Yes, I care about feelings   Yes, I care about feelings   What was it like to grow up as you? Yeah  What was it like to experience this? And, you know, what what is it that you're going to do next? They they want someone else who understands them   They want to be with people   They don't want to be alone   That is powerful   That is intimate That's powerful   Right? Right?   Right? Whatever it is     Yeah   Yeah   Right? Right? That's it   Right?   So so interesting   Correct   So when it comes to how to make disguise, not so useful to the Ultra wealthy, usually     Absolutely   Yeah   And it's not as hard as you might think   It's not convenient again   Right? They're all extremely secure   Right? By buying it   So I'm gonna do what he says   I are they    Until you do something that makes them think otherwise? How how difficult is that is that to do? It's it's not convenient      I I never hesitate to admit this, but people tell me I should hesitate to admit it   Right?  Yeah  But criminal Be like, oh, yeah  I did that once  Yeah   I just told everybody    Dude Right?   Yeah  But we do     That's how we do it   We learn how to do it the right way so that we don't get caught   We learned how to be consistent   It's that's very real     Right? But the truth is that I've I've done this now long enough   So you said when you're were twenty seven, I think you know what the hell you're doing   Had you figured it out yeah  Yourself? No  I'm     I'm grand total of seven days smarter than I was at twenty seven       And it'll be over before you know it   I   Right, Whatever   And then there You don't respect yourself, how can you do anything else? How can you pioneer anything?
