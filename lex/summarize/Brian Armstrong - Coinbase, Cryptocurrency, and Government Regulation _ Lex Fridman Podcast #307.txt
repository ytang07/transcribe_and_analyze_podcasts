Mh   Probably better   No   No  They do for     That's like that's if you're hardcore                 Oh, yeah       It just works    But still is being used why     How does it work? How does it work? What what's cryptocurrency? What does it mean transact? And if you like it, you can hit accept   And then we have to store the crypto that people buy securely as well   We have we      So some crypto and we help them do that  Make it simple and easy to use       Yeah  I'll ask about all that     Right? Right? That's that's know, some     But how do     The     So we're basically debit that   Yeah   The little I know about it  Yeah   But, you know, basically, you give     Right?   How do you protect? How do you har you stay one step ahead? Right? So it's it's like     So you're     So you know, try all the above   So one of the     Right? So you look at to attack to protect against it   Right? So we would     You we're tracking people's Ips   Right? It's like, well, that's very improbable   Yep  That that might be     Actually, you know, I feel embarrassed that I don't know this  Probably should   But how does That even work that well then? And why can't you be fake? Yeah  That's really interesting   It's you   Who's a robot who's not? Yeah   Let me step back     What did that look like? Yeah   Like, what what did it take to write it to think through it and and make it work enough to at least make you believe that it's gonna work   Well, I definitely didn't know if was gonna work   I mean, it was kind of     I felt like I was just following my gut   Project manager     Like, nobody     You know, why would you    Why would you do that?   And I was trying to find I 'm And he was like, yeah, maybe   So then I had this       So you weren't even thinking about to buy the on ramps   Okay  This is       Right?   Like no matter what  And so I I revel in that  I I was sort of    I had      I don't know   Yeah  I you     Yeah   Where where where'd did you go? That probably wouldn't been healthier       I get page   So I get woken up sometimes, like, two or three times a night, like, have to try to fix something go back to sleep   You can get discouraged   And so that was     So that was one   So you you were saying like, here's a dream  I'm trying to create something and now forever     I will never     It's a recoverable   Yeah  Well, I didn't     You're right   Like this what the everybody like we're so we're so tiny now hates us   So is it over? if     Right? And so even if someone's, like, trying, but they're not they're failing  I'm generally rooting for them least are trying right   Can I     Once again put linger on that   Right? But if you listen to too much of it, and you just try to please everyone  You'll never get anything done   And then you you think like, bio genius and I like, I'm a     That's how you become a dictator or whatever   But you also can't care so much about what people think because then you'll never do anything that's truly authentic to yourself   This is measured   Right? He's d most hated     And so  It's interesting you you just look at these day as you so why  Right   And I     Didn't help   So even if people hate what he says or like, at least, I believe it's authentic   Yeah  I've always thought about that too for myself  I'm like, how do I       Right? I'm trying to find out   Mh   As opposed to P and marketing out of fear   Oh, don't say that   Don't say this   Don't that   Because then you you start living in this kinda that pushes you tones bubble They were pissed off at the i was down is    And you said there might be something else Oh, yeah   Somebody posted So we had all this     We we didn't      And so my phone     So I was like, shit I gotta just see who if that's him   They didn't this was very true for me There was times where I just did something instead of debating it endlessly  And like, just try it  You know? Like, right   So we shipped it And, like, there was a couple of times are, like, the minute I shipped it Like her asking her     Exactly? Right   Yeah   That could be difficult to to keep pushing through that   But I suppose that's life   Yeah  That's right   So you're kinda keep     Nothing is working   We're like, okay   Mh      I     Very different   Very different   Yeah   So     yeah, Anyway, sorry  So Yeah   Right? And get really specific about that   It's like usually something pretty hard   Right? So, like, they won't stop talking until you interrupt them   Which for me  I'm    I know I'm always patient and I wait So I'm looking for     Yeah   Can they communicate effectively? Yeah  I mean, there's     And I was always looking for it    You said brain teaser   And it's always been challenging  I I used to     I I still But the reality is it's it's people that haven't actually ever done anything that say work smart    And so I was always suspicious of people that would say works smart   But then I also you know, have I've learned that there is people that are just exceptionally exceptionally efficient   And so like, you can't just disqualify based on that   You have to dig in deeper   And I     And do so   That's one   We haven't done this yet   Yeah   Or are they not engineering? Just    The the the things that had to be solved, what were they?   I remember one of our investors came by one day, and he was like, right     I'd always heard people say that     Right? Where whether that was cybersecurity, It's like, okay   I come up with   Well, let's see   Yeah  I mean, there there's was nobody who had like, more than     So it takes     It's pretty clear   Clear what we're here to do     And it negatively correlates with things    And so you don't really  Whereas in America historically, you know, or high economic freedom countries, you know, people     What why'd did you end up in Argentina? So can you sort of elaborate a little bit further?   Right?   And And they go they go, like, they go print   Right?   Right?  And so Because it     It's it's a it's a d So there's no throat to choke     It's a it's a clever     So because for people who don't know, coinbase is centralized   So I don't think coinbase is fully centralized   There       They don't have to trust us   And what is your yourself custodian your wallet?   Themselves   Store yourself   Like now you     Right? No   We've built one and it's like, but doesn't bleed the I don't really believe that   I'm not trying to like, force anybody to do it It doesn't wanna do it   Right? So it's     You know, it's arguably     It's better for customers   But what do you think Yeah   So, yeah   Yes   And so something that you think like, a committee of people somewhere where things look silly Right? And so it's very difficult   So what do we do? Right? You can't you can't do that and we've been And it's       Yeah  And I    It's so hard for me to know what's     And I     Yeah too   Yeah  I think yeah, both your important   You got i kinda Right? And Mh  You have to     And Why is it is that ever possible to add?   So here here's the     Right? And so if it     That's def   Right? That's great   You want it to be public   What are they worried about what are thinking about?   Yeah   Oh, man   Yeah   Okay   That's what people don't realize     So If the Us can get there, that would be great   So It moves     Yeah  So is it the other categories is the high? Yeah   It could be mentioned first   Right? Right? N t's     Mh   So it'll be very interesting to see where t's go over time    Like, we're more than happy to do anything that's requested       Right? Right? You know, Coinbase does       Right? So yeah, it's it's actually really It's kind of unfortunate  And frustrating as a     Can can you educate me on something? Mh     And there's     Right?   Where we at now? How do we get to a billion? Yeah  Get totally   So a few things   Sorry   Yeah  It does   There's also just     I was still waiting for that     Of     This is basically the new     There's   He talks in there     He looks back at history   Right?     Right?   Right? I probably will be   It's kind of like     So that's pretty crazy   Yeah   Mh   It definitely received some   But yeah  I'll I'll describe what I meant   And if you wanna talk about how it came to that too, we can know about that   They were like, why did Brian need to say that? We're just saying you're gonna work focus on work at work   That's what we were doing already   Yeah  You know? Right? And I didn't really       There were     So, yeah  Eventually, I was like, okay   I just don't feel     So, like, either they're gonna have to go or I'm gonna have to go   What I realized was that We're all here to do work     Let's do that   Yeah  That was really really really refreshing to hear     Like, they get     Yeah  It's fascinating  It it but it was so refreshing because it's rare   Why that's a rare     So you     The city you're mentioning, we     Where like, the innovation was done by people that are very mission driven   I don't know   Anyway   Why do you think that's so rare? Well, because people don't wanna get attacked, it's like super     You don't wanna get canceled   Right? It's super un comfortable    So get attack Yeah  Yeah  I definitely got a attacked  I mean     And I knew it I knew it would be controversial   So that's that's kind of unfortunate   They're they're actually is somewhat adjustable   They they will go along with whatever    Because it sounds reasonable   And they'll kinda get swept up in it   I I just   But, like, the main     It's it's tempting though   So interesting how companies get tempted to to help   Yeah  And maintaining focus, like, you're you're absolutely right   So it it's very refreshing   And it shouldn't be controversial to sort of focus on just getting stuff   Yeah   Well, let me ask you   I mean, do you think that this There's     But do you think that       They're just      And they're starting to freak out a little bit   That's it   And yeah so and then once you have young people that are coming up now, gain power   I think we'll we'll rebalance everything   Right  Could be worse Right? Right?       Right? But that's how     That's how you learn grow   Yeah   So first of all, a little bit more old school, fascinating effort to research hub   So what what what's that about? Yeah   Okay   And one of them     Why couldn't it be much faster? Right? And there's     I don't     Okay? And no no no   Anyway anyway   So mh   So, like, where I could say, I got x y and z, like, look, I'm impressive because this happened on research I think you're right   I don't know   Yeah     So like you say, okay   So it's already     It's sort      Like, this is respect     Yeah   Right?     Yeah  And I feel like bio is tough  Yeah because it's messy  We don't understand it as well   We don't understand that   It's yeah    So people can do whatever they want to be happy  Right? Right? I don't have power   Like, everything is broken and could be better  Including, you know, stuff I'm working on Right? If you wanna try to fix education And so I do think people     Nothing is perfect   Okay? And there's     So    Yeah  It     I I like   That's much more fun than it sounds   Why are we here? He's life yep   Yeah   So why?   And so we and we happen to develop these, like, really cool new    One of those two hopefully works out, and then we get to     I think that's fun   Yeah   So once you realize you can kinda do anything you want Mh     Right?     It could be anything   Right?  Anyway, you     So now I start     Now I'm like, okay   What's the     Okay     Right? I don't know   And so most people today, they look at     So there's whatever whatever     I I love it and listen to it often Thank you for listening   And hope to see you next time
