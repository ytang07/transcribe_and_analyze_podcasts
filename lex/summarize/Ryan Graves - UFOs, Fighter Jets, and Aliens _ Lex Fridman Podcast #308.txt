 So not very interesting   Right? I know   For so what's electronic to warfare? That well f twenty two enough thirty five   Right?   Right? It looks pretty sexy   And so it made it very maneuver   F thirty five   It certainly is   Yeah   No   Is it get how tough does it get?   Yeah   But anyway, so You don't really notice anything   And so that'll get us over the fastest I think Of got was about one point two eight   And is that something that's used off warfare that not really that  No   Mh   And so the hypersonic are really what it is is how fast can we detect and destroy problem? Right? Right? Even mean the Does that happen often? Yeah   I I Yep   I mean, this is happening a lot   And in fact, it seems stressful     Interesting   I didn't know they did that   But so if you immediately if you try to go under them, they're gonna be dropping into you   So you typically wanna try to go above them   Is this something you can train for? Or no? Right?   Yeah   We we'll talk about war in general because, yeah   It's       That was advantage of going that way   Is that essentially choose what I wanted and if I got in  Great   So what     E two And then there's all f       Cool   Oh, it's a pretty plain   Okay  So that's usually not used for finding used for training  It's used for training how to fight   Got it   So what what was that like? Cool   Mh   And right? Now, what that means not just because it's faster whole mine needs to be faster  Everything happens faster in the air now  Right? Those happen faster      It's awesome   Well, I i    Because that's means pretty exciting   So that    I mean, how     Decent said morn you would think   You know, mode It wasn't it wasn't fearful   And and it came down   It came down halfway there just on own   About five or six years later   Right? You can be in the water      That's how science used to be done     It is  So flying in and a     Is this done for you? Or are you as a human supposed to understand? Yeah  This is done autonomously or manually   So    But what we do, is all manual     Right? Right? That's really cool   That's all it is   So you get     Or is it we're staring directly at it? Right? Right? While, you're flying, not looking straight   Correct   It can hurt you that   We don't like doing this as much   And I don't think it's just me   Right? Yeah     Is it is it does it     Right? And that's more and more stressful as you get further   Yeah   How stressful is that? Because, like, you know, we're doing that when we drive staying in lane, and that becomes     After you get pretty good at it, it becomes somewhat   It's still stressful  Mh   Which actually surprisingly stressful   Like, I don't think people realize how stressful it is to lane keep when they drive So this is even more stressful   So do do you do you think about that? It's very stressful   So if you're flying with him and then you fly right to a cloud   Right? Alright? And so you have to be very tight   You might start raining, and then he's turning, but you might not even know that But you're absolutely right   Oh, yeah   Not it's all completely manual   Right? So everything has based     Right? It's it's trivial, but why? Why are they doing that?     Well, I gotta ask So f eighteen, what's the like to fly of fighter jet as best   Right? It wasn't necessarily the this        Instead, right?   I want to Is that what you're saying? I wanna go beyond that   You know So you know, we're gonna be So what's that like?   Yep     And you can do everything perfect and still fail   Right?   We don't do it on our own   Mh   It happened best of us   You know, i'll I've done at once   How much of it is feel?   Correct   Right? You have to think ahead a it   Not just away from you, but also on an angle   Right? So you're constantly doing one of these to correct yourself as you go   Stressful   And you every time you do one of those, yeah   Right? So it wasn't aircraft   And they were fine   Absolutely   Right? And so we we have things we teach     And that's what happens   Right? Could you get the verbal? What's that mean?   Crashed   Mean trash   So you're still you're going super fast   It's all this happening fast   You don't know you don't know what    That the moment it's gonna hit   And dark though, a lot of times it's white     You still have to land     Right? Right? You can't tell anything   It could be upside down   Right? My are telling me and they're turned out as far as i can go  Because you're gonna have to actually How interesting? What do they look like? And it's just so many   Yeah   It's humbling   Okay   I do    So yeah   Thank you, Brother   You're welcome   Like, what are we talking about? This is big is a radar   So when you say that were chosen, this is to test   They are more sensitive   Maybe it needs to be calibrated  Whatever   Right? Right? Correct     It'd be coming out and we goes steady and if they turn, you'd you know, it be like, and you see them turn   Right? Like, it's not magic   But this object, they would     Mh   Is it stationary, you know, and that's just how it puts it out and it's not used seeing Right? And so much like the see, you know, when we're up there, fighting, it affects everything   Would it it would not come off as stationary   Would it sort of float about kind of thing? No   Well, I meant like, Dji draw not like     I'm saying, like, generically speaking   I would   So it could look very stationary   But that wasn't necessarily     Right? You have to kinda look at everything   But     You know? It could be at least from my perspective   Yeah   And this is aerospace where there's not supposed to be anything else at all   Got it   And so nobody is supposed to be out there  It's possible for people to be there  It's not necessarily restricted, but it's well monitored and we're out there day all that Right? It's gonna be locked on straight Because it's not gonna be perfect And these seemed more like that, not that they were imp, but that they were even much more erratic than that    So now we started thinking that, okay, maybe not radar functions  Maybe more, maybe something is physically here, of course, and then people started to try fly by and see it   So, like, they would be aware of it   And then, of course, people would wanna go see what they look like   Right? So people would try to fly by   I try to fly by him   I like how this in, of course   You know? And so it was still     Like, there's stuff that can be learned   Everything's last slide we do out there   Right? Is there something that could be said I don't think it aggressively went at them   I think it was located still there and then they through it    And that would     I don't know that for sure   Was it that were they just not there were being fooled? Was something happening? Were they were they moving, dropping out two the last minute? You know, we're we're going by pretty quick it was difficult to tell   And the jet, of course, didn't know that was there   It's not on radar   So it's sound unclear what it is   You know, Maybe it was a       That's kinda where we were thinking this was going   Was was     It wouldn't really makes sense either too     Psychological   Correct? So looking back now from the    All the pieces of data you've integrated you've personally added  What what do you think it could be? I don't know   I don't know what it could be   Is they're sorry to interrupt is there     Yeah  I think it's perfectly reasonable to think that that could occur  Right? Right? Although I think that's very unlikely   Right? And then n is from       Yes  Yes  And we can't discount it   And then are we     Mh   Or something else that is just something we don't understand How they you're interacting with each other   Right? It's not made available, probably even within the military for analysis   I think so   And can you maybe summarize what you heard   But they you know, they didn't treat this   Right? I think that remains be seen   Right? Mh   I practice that   He does   Mh   I think so   I Right? What do you think?   It's happening right now   And so I     But that's great that they can talk about it   Right? Share Mh   That's a you know, a truly anomalous experience   Right? Right? Yeah  I agree with you   But what about stuff that's happening on the water? That's interesting to me   Mh   You think it would be somewhat as easy as traveling through interstellar or space at at least   Right? Yeah   You know, we don't have great     Right? I can't something go water and then follow it underwater   Right? I was airborne for that one       But not that per pronounced   Right? At least that's how it's being portrayed on the fl   It just was non shape, which is interesting   Right? Right? And it continued along if we were to consider it from a       Like, it wasn't tight   They weren't even, like, super     They were flying as this they were flying close to each other, but not formation, which was kind strange   Right? Mh     Natural  Okay     We're just not gonna go near  You know   We're just not gonna go there   Beautiful   I think that's right on the nose   And that's kinda what broke me out of it and got me thinking more about it     It was, you know, too bizarre   Right? So he basically went back   But, you know, as an avi, I wouldn't know either way   Right? But it seems like there's somewhere to report to   He's     Right? Trust but verify   Should certainly be the mantra   Right? You think about this kind of stuff I do? I Right? We've trained ourselves what to think about what we think is true or or what this would be like      What do you think we will encounter? I think we're going see ability to manipulate matter like use some manipulate information   Maybe you can correct me but sort of quantum mechanical simulation to understand materials Right? Right? Mh   So it's the company I worked for     Right?   Got it     Right   Interesting   Right? Right? Let's travel   But Yeah, people look back at people like you and say, well, they used to fly like, with this kind of propel   Good at it   But yeah  Usually limit   Right? How much do you invest in getting really good at it     Mh   And if you did, you probably wouldn't tell me   I     But it's that's something I think about as well     Also as well    Yeah  So    Yeah, can you elaborate that? Right? Right? Right? Exactly   Does it worry you? So you said building Right? Yeah, It's particularly terrible   It is     And I've seen that firsthand    Well, escort con and, you know, it wasn't easy then, and I'm sure it's not any easier now, especially after what you've just seen They're unmanned     Right? Like, these like, like Dg  Right?   What happens if that is more widespread   Right? Right?   Of course, But it can show you how you can get caught up   Well, let me ask you about this   I think so   I think I think it is until we        Mh So you do     You were able to see the basic it's human versus human   We're both there   Mh   They don't have anything else     He's still young   I suggest that they don't fear looking foolish   And so, you know, I didn't     It doesn't matter   If it's they're good at it   And don't be afraid to look stupid   Don't be afraid to look   They had to really overcome   Actually, I have one   Right? It's all very much   Where am I gonna get my paycheck from? Where am I gonna move to? And when I got out, it     It was difficult for me   Absolutely an escape from the world   Certainly, you know very much is  Was it deliberate that you found it there?     Isn't that strange? How do you how do you square that? I never really kinda sat down to think about the    The mortality of it afterwards Right? You would?  What do you think is the meaning of it all? What's the meaning of life? Why we're here? Right?   Exactly   Right     It was my pleasure   Thank you le
