Yeah   Go ahead   I do   So first of all, let me just jump around     Yeah   What does that mean? Right? So it's     What shall I tell them? And he says, you know, famously I am who I am   There 's You gotta be one of them   Right? So I'm not this or that  I'm not up or down  I'm not here or there   So to be honest to be to be is to      I'm gonna find out  No And that's appropriate when you're talking about God, you know     Mh   Right? But he's not like that   So God can come close   And we come more fully alive   Right??     So it's beyond being is the source of being    Right  Let me make it maybe more more   Right? Right?     Right?   Great  And right     True   Okay  Where's God? We say he's totally other     I've got them  I I understand them  I can I can manipulate them     Now I can't do you   Yeah  He mentioned sin      So that goes right back to Paul   That's the church     You know, I I have Tread obey you Lord But friends, I don't know     And on one of them, somebody asked what's the most challenging of the seven deadly   So first, what are the seven deadly? Right? To get into the scientific   Nothing can escape from it   That's     We're all sinner   Okay? It's like     That's always telling me, you know, look good and sound right   But you're you're lost in something Right? That     And they're flap   And then he has this is cool to     It's heavy     It's beautiful   It's a great     Right? Mic, who's like God?     That's the most fundamental   Yeah   So     That's means at all   And why why don't I have that? Right? Why do I get angry? All them do   All of the W do   So we're all sinner? Yeah  And you mentioned Satan  Where's the      Maybe overwhelmingly sinful   Right? Mh   He's forgotten himself   Right? That's that's where we're tending   That's where God wants us to go   That's the black hole   And now where did do he go? He went all the way into it  To get us out of it     Can you     Because if if I'm willing you're good because it's good for me   As other   That's what love is   That we might become more and more conform to love  But you know, the final calculus, I'll leave that to God  I mean, I     How how effective was i that? Or was I just willing someone's good because it was good for me   See   Right? He he died Right?   So I you you you probably articulated that too   Yeah  I love love   But we have to be hard knows about it   Yeah   Right? And that's not in at all     Right   Right? Yeah  I       Right   I mean, that's     Yep  It's not it's     What makes them happy, what are they afraid of, what are they hoping for? Right? He's one in being with the father   And they're so crazy in love with each other that they    This fulton she put it this way that there's this     They just     They'd love each other with sai   So they they they sing together  You know? What what exact     Like, how it    How do you visualize how do you understand this?   He would love     Mh   Heck I've got an myself   And they have to fall in love with each other   What else can they do? If we do it that way we're gonna miss it     That's the church   Yeah not Mh   So he he understood it not so much organizational as organically again   So it's more symbolic and organic than it is organizational       Right?   Right? So I walk in with that oh, isn't is nice  Look the bishop coming in   Mh   So that's okay   Right? So that's okay   Okay   Mh   Because maybe all that is leading him away from God     Now, God by decide sure  I want you to have this that  I want I wanna provide this to you fine   Then I say thank you, Lord   How can I use it as an instrument of love? So that what can I do? If I'm popular if I am healthy   Okay  Why am I popular? Why am I healthy? How can I use that for you're good? I'm suffering   Right? It'll make you crazy   Right? Right? I they don't discovered it     Right?   Yeah   It's awful   Yes   Absolutely? And then they fell dramatically after that   Sure   Mh  What is       But so is ce   And we still I think take that seriously   So I get it     It's not tied to a particular, but I think through God is tied to everybody   I'm glad there pac in the church     Well, no   Right  I'm glad there were ce, but I'm glad not everyone to celebrate   I wouldn't want that   So that's why it's good   There are some     The actual experience of it, would you     Recently   So not eating     I'd say that   Is that sure   No   And that's been demonstrated over and over again     And that's been proven again and again   So I would tie it more to that  I wouldn't hide this solve   It's completely emotionally un, but it's naming it truthfully enough   You know   And he's really     If one of two con be infinite, the other would be altogether destroyed   Right? But God has described as infinitely good    Therefore God does not exist    But you here's somebody     He does everything right     He he   It's I don't       Yeah   It does seem that history sprinkle with evil and that evil does somehow nudge just towards good   Can we always see it? No     Oh, no     Right?  Like, what gives here  I mean, why would you you love me? I I've always assumed that  And yet, you're presiding over this somehow you're approving of this and doing nothing to get me out of it   Right?  And his    I and and the father said, it was just killing me because I knew I couldn't explain it to him     But I remember thinking this a great metaphor for us vis vis God is Here's God  Infinitely loving God who's with us all the time and we say, what are you doing? Why aren't you taking this away from me? And when we don't, that's     Yeah   You're dealing with suffering all the time with people in pain all the time     What? But But I was there   You know? So there is      Yeah   I I would do exactly that   I would say there's just too much   And then if if wanna to keep pressing it, animal suffering     Do you find particularly challenging? Well, that's the one it's prime of evil Wouldn't that suffice to explain it? So i I get like when natural are speaking are people that pure material   They'll just say, no, That's perfectly adequate   So I I would steal man mad and say, well, show me why we need something more     It seems to me  Because that my my objection to natural   Seems to me         And that's not to say it's not real   That's why You know innovative article   Yeah     How do you explain that? Those are two different   And we do the first one for     I'm just curious   Sorry, where do you think it comes from? There's Yeah   So so so much more to be discovered     But that's really cool To me   This very it's like vi   Why should that be true? It's     I'm with Vi, that's I think really weird and unreasonable and strange   Right? And and we discovered that  You know?   Only Ver turned toward the one   Why would we call it that? That's fine   So what makes this a being? And and the formal is inclusive of the mathematical which is inclusive of the physical   Yeah   Yeah     He's not sure what to make of it   Right? Right   What it what K christianity is what needs to be a christian It's not just it's   That's right     And great     And and and and and then lastly, I saw him   That's how Paul talks   It's it's not the detached, you know, psychologist amusing on arch   Yeah  Things And we've been is important   We can't     And that matters immensely   Right?   Right?   He inspired all of it, right? In Sp   He 's he's breathing through all of it  God is speaking through all of it     Don't I'm gonna say that   I was more perfect   I say they're just different   this wild and wool   it should It's wrong to call them like mythic or or simply literary   Yeah   Oh, I think so    Where just come from? You know, it's more of a lament, you know, god that and we've killed them   And I think, yeah   So I I would be sympathetic with that   And so final causality there, what's drawing us? I said, yeah   I 'll  I I     Now why am I seeking that? Well, how come you want that? Will seek something   There has to be some sum bon right?  What was was word on fire?   How how is that terrifying? Is that exciting to you? Yeah   It's a challenging Yeah   Maybe i'll be above, but I more exciting  You know, I would say, I I liked doing that   So I get that   Like you read it We talked about me   But but I do it   I like it and it's worthwhile   Yeah   Yeah   I think so   Yeah   So I think, yeah, we we confirmed the first   I think they were terrible     And I would say, no   It's not sovereign   Yes or no  And don't you feel free? I decide   It's just up to me to decide  Kinda help us   No   That makes you free, and i I can freely enter into this  So this sovereign self determination business     How how can they have career, they can be proud of or even just the life that can be proud of   Not enough don't  Find what you're good at, but now dedicated to willing the good of the other   You know? That's how you say them   So find what you're good at         It's also what you connect with   Then again, to push back on that      And if you tell a kid, that's definitely to me     Every day  And one are you afraid of it? The uncertainty of it? And what you think happens after you die? Sure   I'm afraid of it   And because it's    I don't I don't know what's next  I mean, I I I can't know what the way I no you    That's true     But I do   But, yeah, i'm sure  I'm afraid of it, because     It's it's the unknown   What do I think happens? He just died recently   Right?   Right?   We say   And you said, what a fantastic idea   Well, I don't know   Right?   That's what I hope for     That's what gives life meaning   As I say moral or less aesthetic intellectual values   Well good   The supreme good, right? And So that that's where I would fit the package together that way   Thank you so much   Great loved it   Thank you
