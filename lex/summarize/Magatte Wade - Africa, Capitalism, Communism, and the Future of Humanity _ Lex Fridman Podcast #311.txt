So not only they're sizing you up but everybody also very invisible  This invisible, how should I say this?   Yes  Yeah  Yes   I know she really is passionate about   I This is amazing   Yeah    It's        We gotta stand for the less lesser fortunate among us   Right? But instead, if you go the way around, then all of a sudden you're pricing them out of market   Same thing with done with us    It's not popular   It's not fun, and people tend to not even understand where you're coming from     And then what was? Right? You are African   I'm African   Right? Various And once we go, they go   It's     That's that's it     Is there a resentment because you mentioned hospitality? Yeah  This is     Right?  Yes  Is is     Don't even gonna get me going on that? I was trying to get for polite today   So just just don't  Let's do not   Okay  You know, sometimes i tell myself, My god  Today you're gonna be all composed  I know next   Open compose i don't go ahead and make the full of yourself  Just just just behave  Yeah  But all it together     That's when it's all gonna     Yeah  So yeah  Let's let's let's move beyond that too     That's when you're lucky   How you very quickly   Exactly   It's a? And it just keeps them going   So it's very       Yes  Beyond factions beyond all of that  That's right   Mh What does it it take for country to prosper?  So you you     Today, I can confidently say yes   So I'm just gonna stick to prosperity because prosperity doesn't necessarily mean sometimes as has nothing to do with maybe how you conduct yourself otherwise socially speaking   Right? No  So what I'm talking about is you're sing, and that's what I love about this We're not talking about when seeking anything like that   So that's what we're talking about   Create  Create value   Right? Sure   Sure   And maybe here? And we know so taught and i did like tell people   And    No  No No   Le, I had it when I was seven knows so   Yeah  So you were always a trouble making i just now  Okay  Great  Life would it be fun about it? Way   Just really trying to keep it together  I know you are with me, I'm gonna totally bring it out   Right  I still we did   It boils    So are you kidding me? And we don't Oh, I I was not     It was just like how come? No   How we can     Right? So where's all     It is   It is   And don't take me wrong legs   Yes   Yes   Yes  Main arteries great fro   To like, whoa, this is moving Yes  We have all of that, but it is still unfortunately just     But so this     I am not    But just accepted it   It's very real   I and I have to hear it   Yes   You need to be said  Others   But you guess what my guess what? Do know why it didn't make sense?   Yeah   And so so then that's what I'm thinking   It cannot be    Can     No  No  No    What is this? And then I go on   What entrepreneurs are are people criticized by creating  Do they always get it right?       I stayed because the women whom I had put back to work by Then   And for me, but bothered me enough    The just have that   And especially when we size by creating, especially when you've been raised   Yes  We are   And oftentimes asked myself, my god, Why you? Why did you     Whatever you decide to do will do that Yet  She's so so dignified  She's so identified  And that already kind of made me like, my got stuck crying but and I told and I told her that I was quitting I did not eyes and and she said look at me  I not   She look at me child   And I looked at her   But for us, you can change everything   And i went back   So that's what entrepreneurs are at their best   Yes  And I I I was I was weak still, but I said you put that aside   And I went back and I fought with everything that I had   Because I it     No  No  No  No  No   Almost   No    Like, the system around you yeah   That's it   Tell them what it is, then we have nothing to give him or anything like that you move on    You make nobody? You still to pay   So     And then, oh, let me walk you through what happened to me when we had to try to get the electricity hooked up   So we go best say, oh, first you have to apply, you know, like you normally you have to apply   And then we apply we pay money   And then we wait and we wait and we wait   This    Your send assistant you goes she comes back   Well, say we send it to wait   I look over it there   This high     How many do you see? I said two   Then I knew I was in trouble  And then I said, what do I do? But eventually, you know, by now, you can tell that I pretty much get what I need because       I explained to him why I'm here? Why I'm trying to do this And even him said lady, someone like you you have no I beg of you  I need I need for this to go on this week   And he said, okay   So people can tell you apart   He's like now what? And I explained to him   And he's like, okay   You can I said, are you kidding me? He's like no   So I called me again, I'm    Otherwise, i probably would still be waiting   You're not married for good too bad Doesn't matter if the circumstances   And I said to him listed, and you listen to me very well It did not happen because you be ill told them, you have to do this   That's what it got us   So let's try to un this   Yeah   Right? I guess what? They do       Now it's costing me one forty   It's now at one forty     You're gonna talk to me about what you're doing right now and how you want to be uniting     That's what you say to me    And if no next  No one  Yeah  You know what I mean? Yeah   So here, you know, My Well that's what we want   I give you this So we went   And he's like, yeah, I know this is not it's not very there  And I said, what do we do now? Because there good to see   Okay    Maybe competitive competition or maybe even them this started the business and they compete with you because we've seen that   So you have to do that   So     Yeah   But next what does it mean? Yeah  Whenever they wanna mess with you? And we're gonna change everything I mean people don't get that    Local level  I know it's that Shiny  I know it's not exciting  But that's where it's at   I preach when I'm here talking to about this, I'm preaching  Mh  I am sharing with people that is which I found    They say, oh, no  It comes from government too   Right? So it's clear   We're talking about     Yes   Right? No   We don't     We don't talk to me like that   It's     You know, they don't have call   They shouldn't but but better not   But they say what     Whatever been say  I'm was like of the scared  You know   If you made it so easy, and straightforward, then, you know what? Let me bring it to them   You don't have to know someone like My god   It's there   You know, I wanna be the next x  Yes  Whatever   All levels     So     And it's almost like like I said, it's almost like it's only to widget within within it   And you know what made me super excited about that  And here we don't know       It's there  Not only the liberation, but also this whole new world that comes with it  You know I'm still I'm still ill, but guess what?   Yeah   Right     Yeah   That's right   And I'm like, because the gospel   What did I talk about? Blah blah blah   I'm like, wait a second   This time around we it did not start with us   So so all of that is happening   So when we're talking, I know we're talking about, you know, you know, it's it's important   We're gonna have to go for that But anyway   It doesn't have to be for profit all the time   Right? But you're like, no, We were ever before  Before what men never said food, who will we    But then the world went on believing, but, oh no, cap failed   But that time it was so hard on people that they're like we're done with this     Right? And by    You said something oh, Say that again  Because I wanna tell you what I'm hearing in because something's really cool  Say it again   Come on     You said   You said there's something revolutionary  Yeah   yeah  I understand     Of course, I don't agree with there   Yeah  It equal write is right, but comes is not   Pretty criticize by creating   Exactly   So so that's why for me   It's that simple     So     Yeah   To know, what I have come to learn  We are not doomed   It's not over for us   We will never catch up   They're still     It's it's not It's        In part a t mh there's    Here  You really are in American  So    But you're also an African  Mh  Who are you? Who are you is     Fix  Success     Yeah  Yeah yeah   It doesn't mean that you have to agree with everything that said   And again, so that is something that I really enjoy especially and something i'm very attached to to this day   And it's it's it's very beautiful I would not have it any other way   It doesn't matter how busy I am, but we're doing it  Actually, to push back a little bit, it's interesting because     Mh   You would feel less fat with     And I think maybe that's what you're sensing there    Yeah  From the   Yeah  Yeah  Yeah I I     It was     So maybe     Okay  No  No  No   No  Okay   Now here, I have to defend the  Sometimes I'm the worst   Okay   Yeah   So   Mh   And I guess, from America I mean i mean don't take me wrong   Absolutely not   You know? Like, just stopping from nowhere where? You're gonna do what start of business and you have nothing to back you up or whatever Right? So we just stop because it just was not flowing anymore   And so So yes   Right? Beautiful   Right   So it's kind of very interesting    And then we are   And, you know, when you come from If we can accept that were    I know we some so cliche some so true, but we're all humans     You're human human, therefore, you could speak it   You're a little human    Right which was right  No  No no  No  No  No  No  No   Yeah   Right  That girl  I don't know what she was thinking   But Yeah  No  So     But what I'm trying to say next is       Yeah  And yet, I know     They all rallied around me     And they said, but there's so much more for you and we don't have it   So we want you to go in find out what it is   My Back I'm like, okay   I'm leaving Come out of here   So no but so this is it   They didn't have to do it   They didn't   And that tells me something   Yeah  You'll find it  It find them  It well fine     Yeah   But can you do that? Can you show up with empathy? As I told you offline, those    I agree with you hundred percent on that   You still all you have is hey   But it is about trying not to stay there   Yes  And it's okay if it takes you years   It is about trying not to stay there   Why? I paused and I'm like, have we learned nothing? Have we learned nothing?   Right?  We force, you know, And eventually, a little by things going through   Of course, you're gonna stay side with you It's very important   You're talking fifty seven you're talking to sixty   When I get     If you have no to make freedom, you're gonna be poor by why? Why why did they go for? Why did we go for? And they don't understand   So there what you have is, but then what happened there? So were like, so there we are     So all of that is starting to happen     So, now this is happening  Be becoming free   But then you look around   What do you see? So     And we also have it's also not      That's what you were     So that's what happened   So yes, I can understand why they did what they did   I can excuse them   No    It this doesn't work   No   But guess what?      And you may still not like us  But you will still respect us because we are forced to be to be dealt with     It be nice if it did   It would be nice   But it doesn't   You bring me on    But you're gonna be foolish and be like, oh, well, Sorry, that's how people breathe  So as black people, we're gonna have to do something different   Let me ask you though   Mh   Does racism exist   Yes, it does   Does it exist yes it does? I say no   I say no   It's     Of course, is just say been done   And I've seen it   It's it might be harder for you   I mean, her    I'm I'm shocked   I'm like, lady, I hear you light loud and clear, but you are too racist   I know   But you told me you are   And for you to think that your racism and makes you less racist and it's that happens too   Find you saying it, it's true   Yes   Do you think it's gonna stop me from doing anything I have to do? No   Might it make it harder longer? That's where it came from   How does it work? Is it true? Is it true? And and what do we do with this? What am I at the against? Right? Right? To now, something is kicking in  Where you have to     In order for you to survive   And this is all wired in   So you don't even understand it   Failure and you need to be able to do so   Do so ever so quickly   See it's so wired in     Otherwise, you have     Right? Only they form a apart   Remember when I told you that most of us a good people, bumbling along, making it up as we're going   Mh   How am I gonna go girl? He's man       Stupid day  Exactly   So every time it thinks it's figured something out  It's never gonna think about it again   I don't know how they said   What do we do?   It's about everything     No   We heard things  And you know and you don't judge? Yeah  You don't judge   And so And she was like, no        It's gonna be more liberal over than that   He said, how do you     How do you balance     You know, you're raised with a family? Yeah  Does man have a family? Right there, you see, it's very subtle   You should almost     Oh, yeah  Okay that was one, or it's, you know, and it's about it's in you   It's we're talking about two, not    Wow  I wonder how I would feel   Right? And because for her was like, how come you?    You you just lower it, you know like, how come? So all of this I take it back  To to     He's gonna stop me if I'm doing anything i want to do? No  It's gonna make it harder   Really   But this is where for anybody who is serious, about making sure about fighting racism   They all joined forces   So today, these people I'm like, why don't we hear more about them?   And what we have to do is to try to pull them up   I I love them   I I They're going where it's hard   How come not? That's what I want see happen   And not like some yeah    Yeah       It only works to make you feel better about how superior you are to me, but it does nothing They're given them give you them    And then guys what happened to us? Right? Guess what happens to them but they Yeah   Can who can who can compete against free So first, they said, we just have to give   I feel like again, we're back to way back    They decide for us   It's like You're not don't tell us what to do as usual   So there's a     It's been challenging for me     Maybe for once we have to watch it for ourselves   You know, we don't wanna be always citing because we're tired  We're tired of always been dragged around and taken for granted and you've vote, you know, come on guys So at least we get them and we don't starve Listen     Yes   You know? But no  Let us go and plead  Don't beg, create instead  Great    I I I know who they are No matter no matter no matter   What are we gonna do dispose of them? And it doesn't it's not much   The wealth that people will need to flourish, they don't need you to give it to them   But it's all about can I let you fly, and you will make it happen for you and also for me, We just lost   He's     He's gone   You did     Yes   Are I basically, you know, all them     It is hard   But I know we're not crazy   They've done it   Right? So in this       I tell people   Listen   Yeah  Everybody   And I just know  I just no legs   Okay You know yeah  It's it's it's hard to fathom actually   But here, it is just     And it's true   Yeah  So everything else we can handle and we will handle You should see them   It's definitely you do   Us we     And So everything we need is there     But I know it's gonna be Yeah   It's truly truly exciting   So with the     Maybe if they couldn't  I don't know   But it helped me because I was able to     You know, sometimes, whatever takes to keep you around, whatever it takes    You know that keeps you afloat you   Yeah  Whatever  Yeah  But between the two of us we're still terrible  We're back   I know exactly you   Exactly right   So you understand me    And you just    I was just hanging onto it   So these women, they carried me   Yeah   Right? And then you start to wonder   And it was very hard to come back from that   And people have a hard     What got you out  What made you overcome that?   I wanted somebody who could help me brainstorm marketing wise    And so And so that's what I wanted to do, and it's what it was needed   So maybe too unfortunately I despise   So I     So we we we he finds me   Here it's free   What is that? So and since then, I have     That's how I understood   We didn't know better   It was it was so easy back when to con everything   No, you can't  I'm sorry  And I will hold you    I will  I will   And that's what I'm doing   Do you know why I could care less?   Right? No  No  No  Oh no   If only you liberate people  We what we know to be true possible, we    All of us are miracle walking around     All of this us   So that's why went     Yeah   Yeah   These still working together? Yeah    Nothing nothing That's how much it is   But I am grateful to you for this   And, yeah, thank you for     But I'm so so happy me   Yes  I need to do more of    Your amazing  I don't know   Because at first I was like le friedman really?
