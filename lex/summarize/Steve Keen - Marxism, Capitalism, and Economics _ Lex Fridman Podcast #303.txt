    Okay     Yep  So we'll we'll we'll go    I'm fascinated by complex systems   Mh   I'm humbled   By them even if their simplest level of, like, cellular     And those are interesting   Those are those are interesting perhaps impossible to model but we can try and we can try to figure out how to approximate them Okay   Let us try to learn something from history   I also see as part of economics   That's where what I'd like to start from and they're called the Physical k That's what we should have stayed and develop from that forward   That led to marx   Mh Money actually adds to demand, and i'll I'll talk we'll talk about that later on     Okay? That's what we should be analyzing      That's wrong   And so that's what makes him interesting   So let me let me try to summarize what you said then you say how stupid I am       We ca n't you can't you can never     And that is really     But Yeah that above   Mine goes up   Okay   Okay?   K? And I think money should be an object for commodity   Okay? Now when you look at it and say, well, how has money created?  Well, money is the     Okay? So that's what that's how the private banks create money   Okay?   Okay? Right     Mh     Okay  Well, I'm gonna interrupt you rude   What are assets? So specific   Okay   No   I renting   You're renting there go That'll be my   Okay   Okay  If you add the two together, you get zero   Okay  So that's zero   That's the right   Okay   Okay   It's the negative the liability   And asset includes money   Yeah   Yeah   And this is at the bank   That's a bad       Yeah   K? That's good   I'll i'll talk you one day   Okay  If I can return you we'll jump around if it's okay  Not fine   You studying him quite a bit  You disagree with him quite a bit  Yep  But you still think it's a powerful I think awful lawn  Yeah  A powerful mine  So first of all, let's let's just explore the human why do you say so?     Yep  And that actually is not h a little     I think it's wild       Right   Oh wow     Yeah   So I read everything is ever written   You're worker   Okay? Mh   Yeah  There's a positive and negative and you bring them together somehow   And and why is why is there attention?   Okay     Okay   How do we set process? Yeah   I see if you made something which didn't work   Okay   Yeah  Then it has    It it might be able to sell it   Does that have the subjective     So the objective is what capitalist worry   I was in       K? Okay?   There's no     Okay  Not how comfortable it makes you feel   K     That's the utility   Twelve minus six is six surplus of value hours, and that's where profit comes from   And I thought it was brilliant   But it also applied to machinery   Right? Okay  That's it's basically said   No  No    You deep is good   Okay     Yes   Okay   Okay? Okay     Want in this     You want        Okay  That has         You got political and you get money coming above that and so on Okay   Okay   Okay   Yeah   And actually, before that, yeah   What is value? Is that this is like me asking what's happiness   So therefore that very subjective of value     It takes to make something Where do you fall? What where do you fall? I think you have     Yeah   Okay? So he said it can't be   Okay, But it is okay with that   He was okay   Yep  He was saying they don't   He he was     It was     And then he     He's human   He could be in     Yeah   Because what    We're not when I did this    When I first read Marx way way back when I was how old was I twenty   Mh   Now I said that     And I got laughed at, I'm quite literally laughed that   So I made a      So i got rid of you get failed because like, why do he think     So it was     No  Really? Not really   But you think Marx is feisty than you? He was fast, but fast was    He could be Arrogant   I'm like, I'm a    I've I've got an intellectual and stuff     Yeah come to accept that   Yeah   Of you're saying Marx is like    Yes ego  That's  Yeah   Yeah  That's that's pretty  Okay  So this is       How did they relate to each other? That's what he was thinking about   Mh   But no   And you     It's it's remarkable     Mh   He says it also has to be contemplated, which was not done before   This is right nice to himself       I'm sure   I don't know   I haven't i've seen original not   So i'd love to see them   But he says legally lives out the word is   Okay   Can can you say that again? Yeah  Is that    Okay   Can you linger on that? I       Because He called them inc inc   Whereas neo make them comme And they can both do that   In fact, they do it together   Okay  So     And we'll go to that   Well, and he couldn't cope with it   So he's     But didn't come about      What's what was his to view? Is that the Utopian     You get what you need It was     Okay? He was wrong   Mh   But also if we can link       Yeah   That's another loaded terrible what is   And that Yeah  Centrally planned   Right? Now out to be one   So yeah  But I there was no    It wasn't public on it   Yeah  So have     But it's     It it it it came incredibly complicated Mh     K? K? K?     Mh   Yeah   Yeah   Okay   Yeah  Okay  And this is what that's how they cope   You're trying to build as fast as possible     And     Mh     K?   So     Okay   Okay   Okay    What is yeah? Is that always     That's interesting   I mean, just scarcity to resource Wait   Yeah  I'm I'm barely thinking at all  So wait   That is about     Okay   Fair enough   Which is what essentially this is   K? Oh, yeah   So I don't see that as     Yeah  Bad right one     We'll return to it if we can  Mh   Yeah   Then it might not have happened   Still remain socialist   Straw politically active Can how that was yes it can? Happened again   We met once, but only once   What's what it's     Could I mate how are doing? Oh not bad   What you been doing recently? Not much   When we going? So not not not not too far  Not too soon  Yeah  Whereas it are not too far away   Okay   Yeah   Yeah  I love that  And there's something unfortunately   Yeah  No   You know it humble you   But you just can't be like     Yeah  I mean, I just    Yeah It drives   It's actually right   Oh, very rapid based of hopeless Well okay  What what's    So it's too simplistic  It's too simplistic   Because it's it's       Yeah  But it     Fundamentally, if you hit somebody hard enough, they go down   Okay  So Alright  Fine  Fine   Yeah   Anyways we got there   He we got there   But and now we've returned but back to marx  So I think that's a destination  I think marx     Okay? And and this is again when neo here is completely wrong empirical completely wrong   Mh   That's it   Okay   Yes  So you're Not motivated   Oh the guy   And one of them sesame   Mh   Yeah   Yeah   Yeah   Yeah     What are we talking about here, even though it's red  Right black it's actually an   He's something   Okay   You help to organize   It is         For a tool   And that worked   And it's still working     Within China     Mh     So he kept on asking why did this happen   Mh   So what did you do? Okay  Now that's destructive of everything   No    So what else do you need?     What else do you want from like? No   I think     Sorry   Yeah     It's not for for the flourish   It's not   So then you they still know  Still know   So if you like kinda like marriage pardon? It's kinda like married   That you can  That's right  Okay   And and people did have fun, and they did feel free, but they didn't wanna go and get divorced   And you get people making decisions or damn know what they're talking about   Take too long to do   It's gonna be cheaper and faster   Have it more soon blah blah blah was a total technical fuck up  Mh   It's gonna Well, that's dani       Sorry   But it's the     Right   It's dreadful   So I think we're walking blind fold into  Well that's    Right   Okay   It's very what's the bird   Yeah  Well you don't say them around here   Yeah  They failed   K? When you face something systemic, rather than episodic, than it's gonna break down   K? Oh, that's too many   Okay   So we're gonna bullshit you until masks don't really work   I And, and you don't     Mh   Okay   So we'll deal with it when it comes   Mh     In ways that we should really really really be thinking about   Okay  Okay   To say that it's trivial, and you didn't   I     I'm reading what the scientist right   Okay? Mh   Okay  Now that is not at all   You've got bubbles everywhere   That's called the climate       We don't know    Extremely  Because like many of the trajectories we might take will be much more costly than they're profitable     So that's what we're toy with   And we are one and a half   We'd actually less them     Okay? They simply have temperature   Mh   Okay  Then so precipitation   Now that's completely wrong   The over   Right   Okay  I'm gonna go for  Them   Sorry  This is     Well no   That     I've become a little bit wait a minute   Yeah  There I wanna be a little bit careful   Sure   Are poor   Very many incredibly poor     How can we really model that? Because it's it's basically you're looking through the fog   I I   Mh   K? So you lose yeah   Right   It's not better and better better   So there's totally new       Yeah  And we haven't got use   Mh   Yeah   Sorry    I do think     There's only a tiny of the band left and then the so gonna us well we survive what we do the earth       So       On the     Yeah   Can we actually linger on that? Well all and it's grounded in the energy that's provided to us but That's what we're we explore   The only freelance yeah   Okay  B, you can't break either   I've got some like   No  I sides   Sure  You know the sleeve where able what I'm wearing   We are living in the simulation   And we think we can continue doing that   We're breaking it down   Mh   We haven't done under capitalist we continue   To realize that ultimately for gun of survive species, we have to respect life in general   Okay? We can't touch it   Yes   No   We can I'll do that     So this the t shirt that says minsk  After not not not my minsk   It's you're simon  I sorry not that hi not   Yep  Is mine and then Har it all arrives     God So there there's like this     Yeah   It's definitely macro it's top down   It's it's not asian based   Yeah   Yeah   I mean, I'll I'll first did that in mathematical Yeah   He doesn't at all That's it   And he never managed those   Did you get far? Or no  Far   Okay   So So I thought, okay   Okay? Mh  Correspond exactly that were falling workers shit   Yeah?       It was stag     What     Give me a second   Yeah   Fundamentally  Sure  Okay  He he's he's politically reasonable, which makes him more dangerous than those the   He's politically       Okay   That's just he can be feisty as well  Oh you can  He can   But hopefully, you really think   I got you   Alright   Well, so so     Okay? Okay? So you can spend what I've lent you Okay? Now according to the could be close to zero Mh   How concerned are you about?     Okay? Now, yes, okay   If you have money that depreciate, then if you don't use it, you lose it fundamentally   So     That's what they want     Yeah  Well, you       Mh   He had a     He 's he 's he   Mh   It's partially what we saw in two thousand seven   Okay  And he's     It should be continued     And that caused to collapse   Well where's the nice        Yeah today   The use value exchange value, d car went through earlier   Kind of dance?   Mh    That wouldn't be happening     Beautiful   That's really interesting  Do     Do you really believe we're individually intelligent and collectively stupid? I do   Can you elaborate     K? Yep   Okay  Now you don't think that's awesome that's     Yeah  It is a catalyst     That's right   Yes  So you think that the collective    I mean     Yeah  But it's     But if we go through blame it, which is quite possible  Yeah   Nature calls me  Let me     Yeah  Mentioned about the economics of it you think does I I think you vital     Okay?       That? If we create machines that cause Exactly   And I think whatever the heck that means whatever the heck that means         Exactly   And I think that's     This is a Yeah   So you have to be extremely careful both   Mh   Let me ask you for advice   Maybe they're interested in economics   So they hadn't seen me for about a decade and they said to what been doing Steve and I talked about what I done   So I explained it to all of them     And one of them said, I wish I'd done that   You 've all   Mh   I I simply couldn't not do it   I don't know why   Yep  Not   Yep  Yep     You can't do anything to change it    Yeah  That was a very heavy      That's said   Yeah   Oh, yeah   There's a a dialect like i love there   She was madly in love with him as well     So you know, only ing, kept him alive financially     So no I think I've felt a bit similar there   It's   K? Alright? Do you     Are you afraid of it? I'm afraid of going through it   I mean I'm I'm i'm agnostic   I'm atheist when pressed and agnostic   It exists   And that itself can't be explained any any scientific manner   Thank you so much   Well thank you time   Okay  Well, you should hold your judgment  I gotta show you the sex dungeon have  You'll you'll     Awesome   K   Alright   I okay man
